Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews

üìå Project Overview:

In this project, I analysed customer sentiments in Amazon product reviews using both SQL and Python-based NLP techniques. The dataset is stored in MySQL, and sentiment classification is performed using SQL queries, VADER, RoBERTa, and Logistic Regression.

üìå Technologies Used:

Python: NLTK, Scikit-learn, Transformers, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn SQL: MySQL for structured storage and sentiment scoring Machine Learning Models: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT) Logistic Regression SQL-based Sentiment Scoring

üìå Implementation Steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ SQL-Based Sentiment Analysis Loaded dataset into MySQL Created a function to count positive and negative words in reviews Calculated sentiment scores using SQL queries

2Ô∏è‚É£ Python-Based Sentiment Analysis VADER: Lexicon-based sentiment analysis RoBERTa: Transformer-based model for deep learning-based sentiment classification Logistic Regression: Supervised ML model trained on review text

3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score comparison Sentiment distribution visualization
